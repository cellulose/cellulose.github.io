Cellulose is now part of [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org)!

The embedded application framework formerly known as <u>cellulose</u> is now part of the [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org) project, to which it was already tightly coupled.  

The resulting project is an integrated platform, framework, and tooling for creating embedded devices using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).
