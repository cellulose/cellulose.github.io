__Cellulose__ is an [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) based framework designed to create small (usually embedded) computing systems called __Cells__.

A __Cell__ provides networking, a built-in REST/JSON HTTP server, soft-real-time state replication, device discovery, remote updatability, programmable control, firmware versioning, and remote network configurability. 

A __Cell__ might be used part of a distributed control system, a component in home automation,  to build a network camera, aquarium monitor, or whatever else you can dream up.
