The following documentation is generated by [ExDoc](http://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc). Until the framework is more mature all documentation is compiled from the master branch of their respective project.

Once the projects become more stable we will provide docs at the lastest stable release and master.

### Master

{% for link in site.data.projects %}
{% if link.docs == true %}
#### [{{link.title}}]({{site.url}}/docs/{{link.name}})
{{link.description}}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
